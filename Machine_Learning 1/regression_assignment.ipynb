It extends the concept of polynomial regression, which originally deals with a single independent variable, to include multiple independent variables."

        "ques 28  What are the limitations of polynomial regression ?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Polynomial regression is highly susceptible to overfitting, especially as the degree of the polynomial increases. As you add more polynomial terms (higher degrees), the model becomes more flexible and can fit the noise in the data rather than the true underlying relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "* As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex and harder to interpret. The coefficients of higher-degree terms do not have simple or intuitive meanings. It becomes difficult to explain the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Polynomial regression can perform poorly when making predictions outside the range of the training data (extrapolation). Due to the nature of polynomial functions, the model may produce extreme and unrealistic predictions for values far beyond the range of the data."
